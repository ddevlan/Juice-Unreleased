# Juice-Unreleased
### Planned Features:
* Also download lyrics to txt
* Maybe download album art, I'd prefer if it were just a random photo of Jarad, it would be easier than looking for specific images for the album covers as most of them are fan made.
* Add format for subsonic server.
## Requirements:
* python
* pip
* youtubesearchpython (pip)

### Usage:
To chose the songs you want to download, edit the input.txt with the desired list of tracks.

Run in terminal: ```python juice.py```

Files will output to ```songs/data``` for fetching urls, and ```songs/mp3s``` for the songs themselves.

Enjoy.
